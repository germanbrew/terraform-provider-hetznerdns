# hetznerdns_zone (Resource)

Provides a Hetzner DNS Zone resource to create, update and delete DNS Zones.

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Simple Example

resource "hetznerdns_zone" "example_com" {
  name = "example.com"
  ttl  = 3600
}

## DNS Zone Delegation

# Subdomain Zone
resource "hetznerdns_zone" "subdomain_example_com" {
  name = "subdomain.example.com"
  ttl  = 300
}

# Primary Domain Zone
resource "hetznerdns_zone" "example_com" {
  name = "example.com"
  ttl  = 300
}

# Nameserver Records for the Subdomain
## This block dynamically creates NS records in the primary domain zone to delegate authority to the subdomain.
## Be aware that the zone must be already created before creating the NS records, otherwise the creation will fail.
## Alternatively, you can use the `hetznerdns_nameserver` data source to get the nameservers and create the NS records.
resource "hetznerdns_record" "example_com-NS" {
  for_each = toset(hetznerdns_zone.mydomain_de.ns)

  zone_id = hetznerdns_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "@"
  type    = "NS"
  value   = each.value
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the DNS zone to create. Must be a valid domain with top level domain. Meaning `<domain>.de` or `<domain>.io`. Don't include sub domains on this level. So, no `sub.<domain>.io`. The Hetzner API rejects attempts to create a zone with a sub domain name.Use a record to create the sub domain.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `ttl` (Number) Time to live of this zone

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Zone identifier
- `ns` (List of String) Name Servers of the zone

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) [Operation Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) consisting of
numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Default: 5m
- `delete` (String) [Operation Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) consisting of
numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Default: 5m
- `read` (String) [Operation Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) consisting of
numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".

  zone_id = data.hetznerdns_zone.example.id
  name    = "@"
  value   = "1.2.3.4"
  type    = "A"
  # You only need to set a TTL if it's different from the zone's TTL above
  ttl = 300
}

# Handle wildcard subdomain (*.example.com)
resource "hetznerdns_record" "all_example_com" {
  zone_id = data.hetznerdns_zone.example.id
